This is the CS50 Final Project: The Maze Project

*You’re on a Caribbean Island vacation with some of your friends. It’s all 
sunshine and fruit drinks, when a mysterious fellow walks up to you on the
beach. He offers each of you a week’s stay at the finest resort on the island if
you and your friends can solve the resort’s garden maze challenge. After a brief
consultation, you and your friends agree. There are some rules, the fellow says,
but you all agree anyway and follow him to the resort.

He tells you that you will all be led into the maze while blindfolded. He goes 
on to say that some time later he will return, and if you and your friends are 
all together, you will win the challenge. Once you’re blindfolded and led into 
the maze, he instructs you and your friends to listen for a bell to ring three 
times at which point each of you may remove the blindfold. Each of you are then 
blindfolded and led into the maze. You all assume you’re together, but when the 
blindfolds are removed, you realize that while you are indeed in the maze, you 
are no longer with your friends - you can see no one. The walls of the maze are 
too high to see over, and they are too thick with thorns to see through or to 
climb over. You decide that the best course of action is to go through the maze 
looking for your friends. You quickly realize that you can call out to them and 
they can hear you and respond with hints as to where they are. Remembering that 
you and your friends have a limited amount of time to get back together before 
the man returns, you dash off through the maze to find them.*
